		<h5>The Idea</h5>
			The Martian Motel Group (MMG) is the lovechild of its founding member and CEO, Robert Carle. 
			It started with a personal desire to prove to the world that he had what it took to see his goals to the end. 
			He partnered with eight other individuals to complete a project that would serve as 
			the foundational platform that made us what we are today. This partnership built on trust and 
			hard work has enabled the MMG to have been awarded the only 8 Star ranking.
		<h5>Nowhere to Go but Up</h5>
			The MMG rose to the top rank as a hotel provider by pursuing 
			innovative ideas, providing outstanding employee relations, and establishing first rate customer 
			services.  When the MMG won a contract with the Air Force to rebuild all of its billetingâ€™s on Earth,
			the group was propelled into a path that would put it in a position to maintain relations all 
			across the globe. As high ranking officials and dignitaries lauded the exquisite quality of establishment, 
			Robert Carle seized every opportunity to expand the business. 
			One year later, after the MMGs dominance of the market plateaued, founder Robert 
			Carl birthed an idea greater than the Immaculate Conception, to take the hotel business to the stars.
		<h5>The End Game </h5>
			After 3 years of talks with NASA, we finally have a few hotels on Mars and have been delivering 
			an 8 star service to our customers for the past 6 years. Being the only hotel business in outer 
			space has its own unique set of challenges, but with the Steven Hawking like mind of founder, 
			Robert Carl, the only limits are the ones we set upon ourselves. Innovation, employee relations, 
			and customer services are at the heart of what that the MMG was built upon and will continue to 
			provide until someone can do it better.
