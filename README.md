# Hotel-Reservation-Project

This website will be designed using a MEAN stack. MEAN is comprised of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js. The website is running of off a Raspberry Pi that will pull files from this repository as needed. To set up a development environment please follow these steps.

# Install Node.js

Go to https://nodejs.org and install v7.0.0 for your operating system.

# Install MongoDB

Go to https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=hero#community and install v3.2.10 for your operating system. Windows 7 64 bit or later users should install the file for Windows Server 2008 R2 64 bit and later, with SSL support.

# Clone this repository

Make a git folder somewhere on your computer and clone this repository over to it. There are many ways to do this. I installed GitBash, but there are some GUI clients that will work as well.

# Start Nodejs Server

Once you have cloned the repository, you should have a hotel-reservation-project folder somewhere. Navigate to this folder via the command line. For example, if your folder is located here C:\git\hotel-reservation-project, you could type cd C:\git\hotel-reservation-project to get there. Alternively, Windows users could navigate via the file explorer to the folder, shift-right-click on it, and select open command window here.

Once you're there enter <b>node app</b> into the command window and it should say Server running on port 3000. If you visit localhost:3000 from your browser and the site comes up, everything is good to go.

# Set up Code Editor

You'll need something to edit the html and javascript files. You could use notepad, but there are better options. Here are a few others:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sublimetext.com">Sublime</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a></li>
</ul>
